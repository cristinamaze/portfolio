            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior at The Ohio State University, pursuing a B.A in Public Affairs with a certificate in full-stack coding development from 
                the College of Engineering. My expected graduation date is Fall 2021, after which I will be pursuing a graduate degree in Public Affairs 
                with a focus on nonprofit studies from the John Glenn College. I have a background in data entry through Mac Tools, a subsidiary of 
                Stanley Black and Decker, and management through USPS Freight.

                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.
